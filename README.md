# leaflet-challenge
**Import and visualize the data by doing the following:**  
- Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

- Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color.  
- Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.

- Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

- Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.  

**Files Updated are as follows:** 
- logic.js = has the code to retrieve and set up the map to retrieve the data and visualize it 
- style.css = file updated to show the color legend based on the magnitude
- html = is updated with the map based on the changes in the logic and style files above.
